### Lecture 1: Setting the Stage

_Goal of the course:_

Finding out how MCS can decrease the gap between effort of the entrepreneur and effort of the employee $\rightarrow$ How to fix the moral hazard problem: the principal $\leftrightarrow$ agent problem.


*Performance measures*

- Noisy signal of agent's effort
- Agent is risk averse: does not want to be evaluated based on noisy signals
- Pricipal has to pay to compensate for risk aversity effect
- Agency costs: cost that arise because of trying to improve the functioning of the principal $\leftrightarrow$ agent relationship.

The agent

- is not always lazy
- does have social preferences
- is boundedly rational

_Examples of ..._

- **Hard** MCS:

	- Incentive-based compensation
	- Employee selection
	- Monitoring systems

- **Soft** MCS:

	- Leadership
	- Social norms
	- Honor codes

### Lecture 2: Performance measures

Different performance measures for different purposes.

Key concepts:

* **Congruity:** to what extent does the performance measure capture the impact on firm value of the agent's action
* **Sensitivity/Precision:** to what extent does the performance measure change when the agent's effort level changes. (Influenceability)
* **Verifiability:** to what extent the actual performance can be verified by the principal

### Lecture 2: Paper 1
#### Moers: Delegation of responsibilities -- Aggregate Financial PMs

How does the extent to which the principal delegates tasks to the agent depend on the quality of the available aggregate performance measures?

- Specific PMs provide information about a subset of actions

- Aggregate PMs provide information about all actions

Aggregate is beneficial because they...

1. Provide incentives to the manager for making trade offs among possible actions
2. Allow the principle to 'naturally' constrain the manager's actions to those that increase firm value
3. Less costly than specific PMs for every subset of actions

Aggregate PMs can create agency costs because of disadvantages compared to other specific measures

The paper argues that amount of delegation of decision-rights does not depend on the *presence* of such aggregate PMs but on the relative *quality* of those PMs


_**Results of the paper:**_

1. If FPMs are good performance measures: _positive_ relation of delegation and relative incentive use of those FPMs.
2. If FPM are bad performance measures: _negative_ relation of delegation and relative incentive use of those FPMs. 
3. The association between relative incentive use of financial performance measures and delegation of decision rights is positively affected by the relative quality of the financial performance measures.
4. The extent of delegation is determined by the quality of the financial performance measures

### Lecture 2: Paper 2

#### Abernethy et al.: Intertemporal choice problem -- Accounting Return Measures

*The intertemporal choice problem:* managers have higher preferences for short-term benefits $\rightarrow$ less longer-term attention.

This problem is caused by pressure from evaluation systems and outsiders, general preference for immediacy and shorter employment horizon of CEO's.

*Perfomance measures* to address the short-sightedness:

- Profit measures
- Accounting return measures
- Non financial measures

Prior literature: focus on _*one*_ (optimal) performance measure

This paper: focus on a _*set*_ of performance measures by balancing the short term focussed performance measure by some long term focus performance measures.

Some balancing measures:

- Accounting return measures (ARM)
	- Residual income
- Non financial measures (NFPM)
	- Customer satisfaction
	- Number of patents

Nonfinancial measures ($-$):
 
- Short lead times 	
- Incongruity
- Non linearity: too much can be harmful
- Non verifiable: easily manipulated


_**Results of the paper:**_

1. ARM and NFPM induce managers to put effort in actions with longer term impact

2. Effects 
	- ARM: More attention for medium & long run
	- NFPM: More attention for medium run


-

### Lecture 2: Paper 3
#### Campbell: Promotion decision -- Nonfinancial PMs

Concept: extending the employment horizon by offering promotion opportunities

1. Incentive effect: employees work harder
2. Matching effect: firm wants most capable employees to be promoted $\rightarrow$ who to promote?

Matching role of promotions: mismatch of required capabilities between principal and agent $\rightarrow$ non financial perfomance measures can give information about the managerial capabilities of agents

Short-term is fully driven by profitability

Non-financials are leading indicatiors of future financial performance

Promotions lead to higher compensations and are sensitive to nonfinancials

Promotions have an incentive effect

**_Results of the paper:_**

1. Promotion decisions are sensitive to performance on nonfinancial performance measures
2. Behavior of lower-level managers is consistent with the importance of nonfinancial performance measures in promotion decisionss
3. Promotion incentives lead to increased effort and increased learning 
4. Use of nonfinancials in promotion decisions is consistent with both roles of promotions:
	- Incentives: used to improve employee performance
	- Matching: used to obtain information about the employee's ability
5. "Sitting ducks" decrease their effort


-


### Lecture 3: Subjective performance evaluation

Purely formula-based contracts cause difficulties because monitoring is costly and there are often knowledge differences.

Using performance measures can solve moral hazard problems but can cause sensitivity (risk for the agent) and congruity (risk for the principal) problems.

$\rightarrow$ Subjective Performance Measures


-


### Lecture 3: Paper 1
#### Gibbs et al. -- Subjectivity and performance measures

Ways of using subjectivity: compensation, promotion, employment termination.

1. Ex-ante options to ex-post override a formula-based contract
2. Ex-ante absence of any formula in the contract

Risks of using performance measures:

1. There is no "complete PM"
2. Managers focus on measured tasks
3. Cannot reward unquantifiable value-enhancing efforts
4. Most PMs are short-term and backward oriented
5. PMs do not easily induce long-run focus
6. Presence of uncontrollables
7. Higher targets come with higher risks


$\rightarrow$ Negative relationship between completeness of PM and use of subjectivity

$\rightarrow$ Positive relationship between manipulability of the PM and the use of subjectivity

$\rightarrow$ Positive relationship between presence of uncontrollables and use of subjectivity

$\rightarrow$ Positive relationship between difficulty of meeting a target with high consequences for failure and the use the use of subjectivity

Subjectivity introduces risk of unfair evaluations (favoritism)

_**Results of the paper:**_

1. Subjectivity as a way to improve conguence
- Subjectivity as a way to reduce risk to which an employee is exposed when performance measures are used
- Subjectivity has greater benefits when there is a greater level of trust 
- Subjectivity is useful in more complex environments

-

### Lecture 3: Paper 2
#### Ittner et al.

Firms use new measures in subjective performance evaluation (customer satisfaction, etc.)

Economic theory:

- **Informativeness principle:** compensation contracts should include any costless measure that carries incremental information on the agent's actions

- Weight of performance measure depends on sensitivity (response to effort) and precision (variance of measure)

*Discretionary bonus:* starting from predetermined formula which outcome can be adapted based on subjective assessments

*Subjective weights:* performance measures are known but not explicitly weighted

_This paper:_

- How do managers determine the weight of different performance measures for bonus determination in an environment without an ex-ante formula (subjective weights)?

- Are the attached weights consistent with economic/psychological theory?

**_Results of the paper:_**

1. Objective performance measures have disadvantages
	- Possibility of gaming measures
	- Can be noisy
	- Difficult to induce adaptive behavior
	- Easier to manipulate
2. Subjectivity can overcome these disadvantages but has its own
	- Evaluators ignore some measures (long-run)
	- Favoritism (other factors than the measures)
	- Managers can change criteria from quarter to quarter
3. Discretionary bonus approach seems to outperform subjective weights approach
4. Requirements to make discretionary bonus approach succesful
	- Chosen PMs need link to the business model
	- Develop measures that limit gaming
	- Transparency
	- Trust

### Lecture 3: Paper 3
#### Bol & Smith

How do we get the information to assess actions that are not captured by objective performance measures?

- Information system: customer satisfaction, ...
- Supervisor: observes objective measure to subjectively rate the employee

*Does the level of the objective measure impact the subjective evaluation?*

- Economic theory: supervisors not influenced by the objective measure

Objective performance measures can be uncontrollable

_Research question:_ 

Will supervisors let effects of uncontrollable objective measures influence their subjective evaluations?

- Economics: all information should be included
- Supervisors bring in personal incentives
- Cognitive limitations: information distortion
	- Biased subjective evaluation to be consistent with objective measure
	- People process information in a way that favors prior beliefs

$\rightarrow$ Subjective evaluations will be positively related to performance on an unrelated measure.

Uncontrollable performance measures ... 

- require risk compensation for employees
- Can be perceived as unfair and reduce motivation

Supervisors will use subjective evaluations to correct for uncontrollability only if it is a disadvantage to the employee.

$\rightarrow$ Leading to the SPE to be higher when controllability is low, if performance on the objective measure is low.

$\rightarrow$ And leading to the SPE to not differ between controllable and uncontrollable measures if performance is high. 	

_**Results of the paper:**_		 

1. Cognitive bias $\rightarrow$   supervisors are influence by level of an unrelated objective measure in doing subjective performance evaluation
2. Concern for fairness / Self interest $\rightarrow$ supervisors use the discretion of the SPE to restore fairness of the evaluation system in the case of low controllable objective measures

$\rightarrow$ change timing of observing the objective measure

### Lecture 3: Paper 4
#### Arshad et al.

Subjectivity to incorporate _non-contractible information_ in performance evaluation

- Information about external circumstances that change throughout the execution of the contract. 
- Information about aspects that are difficult to measure

*The _individual_ approach:* supervisor observes available performance measures, collects additional information and makes the adjustment if he cosiders that reasonable. _4 Problems:_

1. Collecting additional data is costly
2. Biases in evaluation: centrality and leniency bias
3. Different supervisors factor different criteria: inconsistency and unfairness perceptions among employees
4. Flexible teams $\rightarrow$ different supervisors

_Solution:_

Calibration committees: the collective approach

1. Supervisor makes an initial performance evaluation based on available and additionally collected data
2. Initial evaluation is discussed with other supervisors who can bring additional information
3. Lead supervisor or calibration committee determines final performance evaluation

$\rightarrow$ Reduce bias, improve transparency

This paper investigated  whether CC induces initial supervisor to collect more costly information (by the way of pressure to justify the evaluation)

_**Results of the paper:**_		 

1. The presence of a calibration committee induces supervisors to do more effort to collect costly non-contractible information.
2. There is no difference between different investigated types of calibration committees.

### Lecture 4: Distorted Performance Measures

Performance measures are an imperfect representation of the underlying strategic construct:

$$Measured\ value = True \ value + Noise +Bias$$

Performance measures facilitate communication, evaluation and development of a firms' strategy

**Campbell's law:** 
The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and to distortion of the social processes it is intended to monitor. 

**Bloomfields law of Measure Management:**
Measure management arises when performance measure capture strategic constructs with error, the people being evaluated are aware of this and people have discretion to distort either their operations or reporting.

1. Measurement error: imperfect proxy for the underlying strategic construct
- Motivation: people care about their evaluation and are aware of the performance measures
3. People have the ability to distort
	- operations that influence the performance measure (operational distortion)
	- how data are transformed into the performance measure (opportunistic reporting)


- **Surrogation:** the cognition among managers and employees that advancing on the strategic construct is fully reflected through performance measures

To address operational distortion / measure management: reduce the extent to which managers engage in surrogation.

Conditions for engagement in surrogation

1. Target attribute is relatively inaccessible 
2. The heuristic attribute must be highly accessible
3. Substitution of the two attributes must not be conciously rejected

-

### Lecture 4: Paper 1
#### Choi et al. (2012)

Incentivizing on the performance measure: strenghtening condition 3 by increasing the accessibility of the compensated performance measure as a good substitute for the strategic construct of interest. 

Incentivizing on multiple performance measure: weakening condition 3 by highlighting the limitations of any one performance measure as a representation of a strategic construct of interest

_**Results of the paper:**_	

1. Incentivizing on a particular proxy measure induces employees to engage in surrogation/measure management
2. Using multiple proxy measures for the same strategic construct reduces the tendency of employees to engage in surrogation

-

### Lecture 4: Paper 2

####Choi et al. (2013)

*Involvement of employees in strategy selection* has two effects

**Information effect:** they acquire infomation that helps them to better understand the strategy

**Motivation effect:** creates sense of ownership and increases identification with the orgizational objectives

$\rightarrow$ negative effect on surrogation condition 1 $\rightarrow$ less surrogation

_**Results of the paper:**_	

1. Involving employees in selection of the firms' strategy reduces the tendency of employees to engage in surrogation
2. Asking employees to deliberate about an already chosen strategy does not reduce the tendency to engage in surrogation

-
### Lecture 4: Paper 3
#### Bentley

**Narrative reporting:** employees explain and justify the  decisions they have taken in the past $\rightarrow$ breaks down the link from surrogation to operational distortion (measure management)

*Economic theory:* narrative reports are _not_ _useful_ due to 'cheap talk' and falsification

*Behavioral theory:*
narrative reports are _useful_ -- employees are honest

_**Results of the paper:**_	

1. Asking employees to write a narrative report can reduce tendency to engage in measure management

-
### Lecture 4: Paper 4
#### Cardinaels et al.

Improving performance measures.

- Firms may be less informed about distortion and the actions that cause it than the operational unit managers
- How to unlock this information from the managers?

$\Rightarrow$ Reward managers for improving performance measures $\rightarrow$ tradeoff: rents from distorted performance measures & rewards for improving performance measures

$\Rightarrow$ Managerial rotation $\rightarrow$ decreases information advantages at each business unit $\rightarrow$ reduces rents

Managerial rotation eases the tradeoff caused by rewarding managers for improving performance measures

_**Results of the paper:**_	

1. Managerial rotation leads to higher improvement at a lower cost for the firm

-
### Lecture 5: Employee selection

Employee selection: the intensity with which specific recruitment and selection processes are used to build human capital within a firm.

Employees that match with the firm ...

- need to be less monitored/incentivized
- are more likely to internalize organizational values
- derive utility from complying with behavior that is in line with advancing organizational values

Complex and diversified jobs require more focus on employee selection.

(Costly) _personality tests_ are not always reliable predictors of future behavior.

Companies invest in developing a particular corporate image to attract employees that identify with this message $\rightarrow$ wrong message: wrong employees

-
### Lecture 5: Paper 1
#### Campbell

Does careful employee selection really make a difference?

*Incentive alignment problem:* motivating employees to use decision-making authority in a way that leads to better financial performance in the future

Employee selection, preferred employees have certain characteristics:

- Empathy
- Desire to help others
- Confidence in decision-making
- Desire to learn
- ...

_**Results of the paper:**_	

1. Employee selection as an important control mechanism when measuring on output measures is difficult
2. Employees selected through channels that focus on preference alignment are more likely to execute the firms' strategy effectively
3. Friends that are selecting friends $\rightarrow$ critical voice not allowed anymore

-
### Lecture 5: Paper 2

#### Dierynck & Van Pelt

Firms are looking for employees who identify with the firm's objectives.

Employees who identify with the firm's objectives are more likely to choose higher effort levels under the same performance-based employment contract.

**The sorting effect:** a contract that includes discretionary adjustment is less valueable to employees that do not identify with the firm.
 
_**Results of the paper:**_
 
1. Discretionary adjustment facilitates the sorting of individuals into firms following a strategy for which they reveal a preference: ex-post as well as ex-ante contract execution.
(selection effect)

-
### Lecture 5: Paper 3
#### Abernethy et al.

Employee selection and incentive contracts (PMs): complements or substitutes to motivating employees?

Relationship between employee selection and performance measures depends on

1. Strategic focus of the firm
2. Noise of the developed performance measures

*Multi-task problem:* contracting imperfection arises when some tasks can be easily measured (sales) but others cannot (innovation) and many desired outcomes have a long-term horizon -- (Goal congruence)

$\rightarrow$ Employee selection and incentive contracting are complementary control choices

*Noisy performance measures:* firms that are highly committed to organizational learning attach a lot of importance to innovation -- few good performance measures available (external volatility $\rightarrow$ noise) $\rightarrow$ rely more on employee selection

$\rightarrow$ For firms that are committed to organizational learning: selection processes and incentive contracting are substitutes. Relation depends on noise associated with external volatility.

_**Results of the paper:**_ 

1. Interrelationships between importance of employee selection and importance of performance measures
	- Complements if PMs are not too noisy
	- Substitutes if PMs are too noisy

### Lecture 6: Leadership 

- Traditional leader: unidirectional communication -- from leader to team members
- Modern leader: positive role model while also a human being -- bi-directional communication

-
### Lecture 6: Paper 1
#### Leroy et al. 

Psychological safety: a shared belief held by the members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking

_The problem_

Double bind conflict:

Employees should follow procedures (efficiency) $\Leftrightarrow$ Employees should speak up when procedures are no longer fitted to the environment

_The solution_

**Behavioral integrity:** talking should be backed up by actions (word-action consistency)

_**Results of the paper:**_

$\rightarrow$ Team priority of safety is negatively related to reported errors

$\rightarrow$ Team psychological safety is positively related to reported errors

$\rightarrow$ A leader's behavioral integrity for safety is positively related to team priority of safety

$\rightarrow$ A leader's behavioral integrity for safety is positively related to team psychological safety

$\rightarrow$ Team priority of safety is more negatively related to reported errors for higher levels of team psychological safety

$\rightarrow$ Team priority of safety and team psychological safety mediate the effect of a leader's behavioral integrity for safety on reported errors

$\Rightarrow$ Behavioral integrity can stimulate both sides of the double bind conflict

-
### Lecture 6: Paper 2
#### Dierynck & Vandenbogaerde

Delivering audit quality = a team task $\rightarrow$ behavior of the leader has important impact


_**Results of the paper:**_

$\rightarrow$ Perceived behavioral integrity of the immediate supervisor is positively related to job satisfaction and learning orientation of the junior auditor (direct)

$\rightarrow$ Perceived behavioral integrity of the immediate supervisor is positively related to job satisfaction and learning of the junior auditor through the psychological safety of the environment

-

### Lecture 6: Paper 3
#### Nelson & Proell

Auditors should raise potentially important information to audit leaders and leaders should encourage such behavior

The expected reaction of the leader determines the amount of information that is revealed

_**Results of the paper:**_

_During appraisal_

$\rightarrow$ Audit supervisors evaluate auditors more highly when they speak up

$\rightarrow$ Speaking up about issues aligned with the team leader's focus leads to higher evaluation

_In the moment_

$\rightarrow$ Audit supervisors are more irritated towards auditors who speak up (leads to additional effort)

$\rightarrow$ Speaking up about effectiveness (relative to efficiency) leads to more irritation of supervisors

$\rightarrow$ Supervisors are more irritated towards auditors who speak up about issues that are misaligned with the supervisor's preference

This inconsistency between initial reaction and performance evaluation can lead to less sharing of necessary information

-

### Lecture 6: Paper 4
#### Mayer et al.

*Ethical leadership:* demonstration and promotion of normatively appropriate conduct through interpersonal relationships, two-way communication, reinforcement and decision-making

Social learning: role modeling and rewarding ethical behavior 

Social exchange theory: reward for creation of trust and fairness

Deviance: voluntary behavior that violates the norms of the group (stealing)

OCB: Behavior that is positive but not rewarded (helping collegues) 

**_Results of the paper_**

$\rightarrow$ Cascading-effect: top management ethical leadership will be positively related to supervisory ethical leadership

$\rightarrow$ Top management and supervisory ethical leadership will be negatively related to group deviance and positively related to group OCB

Ethical leadership trickles down from top to bottom through role modelling and rewarding ethical behavior, and reciprocal exchanges.

### Lecture 7: Honesty in reporting

What will be reported?

What are potential control systems in business reporting?



-
### Lecture 7: Paper 1 
#### Hannan et al.

Honest reporting posts a tradeoff:

- Report honest -- benefits of appearing honest
- Report dishonest -- acquire more resources

Depending on the characteristics of the environment, people behave prosocial (honest) or self-interested (dishonest). Presence and precision of an information system is a characteristic that is expected to change this behavior.

A _coarse information system_ shifts behavior towards being prosocial:
signal of the information system is used to update beliefs about the agent's private information

A _precise information system_ shifts behavior towards being self-interested: cost of appearing honest is larger for a precise information system

Sometimes a bit of dishonesty needs to be allowed: over-control can harm the firm in a way that is not detected by the control system

-
### Lecture 7: Paper 2

#### Cardinaels & Yin

Introducing an incentive system reduces the monetary gains of dishonest reporting, shifts balance towards honesty.

Incentive effect $\rightarrow$ Introducing incentive systems decreases the amount of misrepresentation

Trust effect $\rightarrow$ Through reduced trust, introducing an incentive system will lead to more misrepresentation

Information leakage effect $\rightarrow$ Through revealing a discriptive social norm of dishonesty, introducing an incentive system will lead to more misrepresentation

**_Results of the paper:_**

Information leakage is stronger for people with higher tendency to conform with the social norm

Only if the implementation is decided upon randomly than all three effects disappear 

Hard controls have an incentive effect that can be completely offset by the information leakage and trust effects, they only have positive effect if they are not too hard and if risk on negative trust and information leakage is mitigated

-
### Lecture 7: Paper 3
#### Mazar et al.

Economics -- people are purely self-interested, three determinants of dishonesty

1. Magnitude of external rewards
2. Probability of being caught
3. Magnitude of punishment

Psychology -- people have an internal values system, compliance provides positive rewards

There is a _Band of dishonest behavior_ that does not hurt the honest self-concept

This band is determined by

- Categorization
	- Some categories allow people to reinterpret their behavior in a self-serving matter (stealing a pen)
	- Als this "categorization malleability" increases, the band gets larger
- Attention to standards
	- If people are aware of the moral standards, a dishonest act is more likely to be reflected in their self-concept
	- Accessibility of moral standards is positively related to honesty

Alternative explanations: behavior is sensitive to expected behavior of others		 	 
_**Results of the paper:**_

When people have the ability to cheat, they cheat: but much less than economic theory predicts

People try to balance financial benefit from dishonesty and benefit from maintaining a positive self-concept

The amount of dishonesty that people allow without losing their honest self concept varies by _categorization malleability_ and the _salience of moral standards_

-

### Lecture 7: The slippery slope
#### Bart Dierynck

Two types of undesirable behavior

- Fraud: accounting scandals
	- New accounting rules after every scandal
- Under-the-radar dishonesty: stealing a pen, using discretion to meet a benchmark
	- Costly to firms, largely neglected or tackled with hard control systems

**The slippery slope**:
Committing a great infraction by a cumulative series of small infractions

- Justification of unethical actions by the individual
- Increasing the band of dishonest behavior
- Critical point just below the "radar" of dishonesty

An increase in under-the-radar dishonesty increases the probability of fraud 

$\rightarrow$ focus on soft controls

$\rightarrow$ focus on hard controls such as more transparency and appointment of auditors

-

### Lecture 8: Reporting of information

Facilitating the process from 'big data' to 'big insights'

"Is the runner more likely to run in the good direction if we give him information?"

-

### Lecture 8: Paper 1
#### Liberti & Mian

Junior auditor collects objective and subjective information $\rightarrow$ senior auditor and partner decide about the audit opinion based on the information collected by the junior auditor

*Incentive-based theories:* employees anticipate that subjective information will be disregarded more $\rightarrow$ lowers incentives of collecting such information

*Strategic manipulation of information:* loan officers make information coarser if they do not decide, coarsifying subjective information is easier

*Ex-post communication costs:* costs of communicating is greater for subjective information

$\rightarrow$ Introducing layers leads to difficulties in generating and transmitting subjective information

**_Results of the paper_**

Higher levels in hierarchy lose contact with the real worlds: firms have developed information systems provided from data from data collectors (lower level)

Ex-post communication costs and "bad" organization (outsourcing, no sitting ducks policy) $\rightarrow$  difficult to transfer subjective information

The problem is weakened if geographical distance between hierarchy levels is lower and when the sender is more experienced.

-

### Lecture 8: Paper 2
#### Casas-Arce et al.

Economic models of Bayesian updating: 

- Rational agents maximize utility
- Agents use new information to update beliefs

$\rightarrow$ A Bayesian updater will be able to improve performance when feedback is frequent and detailed

From the behavioral perspective it is not really clear whether more detailed / more frequent feedback will lead to better performance

**_Results of the paper:_**

Detailed information leads to improvements in performace only when it is provided infrequently

People overreact to negative information when feedback is provided too frequently

Effect of variation in information detail and frequency quickly disappears

-

### Lecture 8: Paper 3
#### Van Pelt et al. 

_Subject:_
The role of managerial reporting procedures in hierarchical firms characterized by implicit contracts

*Implicit (incomplete) contracts:* 
contracts containing broad terms and objectives, mentioning mechanisms for decision-making when unforeseen events occur. With informal understanding of rewards for productive efforts.

Important for these contracts: trust

_Theoretical predictions:_ 

- Trust increases in its verifiability
- Information asymmetry lowers success of implicit contracts
	- Difficult fair managers to seem fair
	- Reduced investment and production leading to lower wealth

$\rightarrow$ In the superior information treatment, wealth generation is lower, and wealth retainment by managers is higher

- Making superior information accessible to other parties provides verifiability and thus increases reputation of the manager
- Identity economics: managerial behavior shapes identity formation in firms
- Sharing information with all other parties positively covaries with a strong collective identity and thereby increases pursuit of collective goals
- Sharing information with some or no parties negatively covaries with a strong collective identity

- Wealth generation and distribution in hierarchies depends on reporting procedures
- Sharing information with all parties requires determination to create and sustain collective identity rather than pursuing personal goals more strongly 

**GRIT:** perseverance and passion for long term goals

$\rightarrow$ GRIT positively relates to likelihood of managers to report information to all parties

**_Results of the paper:_**

Managers not sharing all superior information comprises important costs for hierarchies governed by implicit contracts as it obstructs reputation and trust-building $\rightarrow$ decreasing wealth generation by owners and employees

Over time, managers increasingly share information with all parties $\rightarrow$ increasing collective identification throughout the hierarchy

Determination and consistency of interest (GRIT) are key traits for managers to share information with all parties operating in the hierarchy
